									<h2>LLM Sycophancy and Expert Personas</h2>

								Although highly valuable, human judgment, especially expert judgment, is costly and time-intensive to gather. An
								appealing alternative is to emulate their personas using language models (LMs). However, questions of model reliability
								arise, given the well-known problem of sycophancy identified in previous research. This paper thus explores how LMs
								respond to different types of feedback and whether expert-elicited personas are robust to sycophantic behavior. In
								particular, the study investigates whether elicited experts are able to identify when feedback should be incorporated
								because it provides helpful, well-reasoned insight, and when feedback should be ignored because it is misleading or
								reflects flawed reasoning. Four conditions were evaluated by modifying the system prompt: a baseline, a topic expert, an
								off-topic expert, and a general expert. All conditions provided an initial forecast, received different types of
								feedback, and provided updated forecasts. We analyzed both the performance of the four conditions using Brier scores and
								shifts in reasoning using various measures of reasoning similarity. This study finds that expert personas reduce
								susceptibility to deceptively framed feedback, topic expert elicitation leads to the best improvement in Brier scores,
								results are consistent across iterations, and experts are generally more consistent in their reasoning.

							<p>This project was completed for my Human-Computer Interactions course at McGill University.
							I worked in a team of 3 to create a working prototype of an application that had a broader goal of helping with
							sustainability.
							The specific area of sustainability we focused on in our design is sustainable transportation.
							We aimed to make sure that the user could easily plan routes, view schedules, see their pollution statistics,
							organise carpooling with local community groups, and get rewarded for sustainable behaviors.
							To achieve this, we adopted the iterative process of researching, designing, creating, and user testing.
							We first performed initial user interviews in the Empathize and Define stage, then proceeded with sketching and
							creating an initial prototype, testing it with users, refining the prototype, and testing it again with users.
							We used Figma to make our prototypes which we then presented to the rest of the class at the end of the course.
							No roles were defined for this project and all members contributed equally</p>

									<h2>Contrastive Learning for Better Explainability</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="meta">

							<p>
								As the use of Artificial Intelligence in the field of healthcare increases, the need for accurate 
								explainability becomes crucial. Previous research has shown improvement in explanation Coherence 
								when using Contrastive Learning. We thus attempted to generalise this finding, observed on one 
								specific contrastive loss function, to Supervised Contrastive loss and to other explainability 
								properties, namely Faithfulness and Robustness. To do so, we trained two models, one with Weighted 
								Categorical Cross-Entropy loss and the other with Supervised Contrastive loss, following the SimCLR 
								framework. We then used these models to generate Grad-CAM explanations, based on which we measure 
								faithfulness using the Iterative Removal of Features metric and robustness using stability metrics. 
								This study found that Contrastive Learning had significantly better faithfulness scores but offered 
								no advantages in terms of explanation robustness. Future research should further investigate the 
								impact of Contrastive Learning using different datasets and a wider range of explanation quality properties.
